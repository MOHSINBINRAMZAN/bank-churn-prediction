**Bank Churn Prediction AI Project**
an AI model that helps banks understand why customers might leave and predict those at risk of churning. By analyzing customer data like transaction history, account balances, and service usage, the model identifies patterns and factors leading to churn. This way, banks can proactively engage with at-risk customers, improving retention and enhancing customer satisfaction. Ultimately, this AI solution supports better customer service and reduces the loss of valuable clients.
